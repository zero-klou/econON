Hi, this is my first real front-end project. 
Create you pull-requests please if you want contribute it. 
Also, i will be glad if you give me some advices about my JS code. Thanks.

P.S. I told it's my first front-end project? However, it's my last front project too. I like JS, but i more interested in back-end. 
Although I donâ€™t know in advance, maybe i'll be back.
P.P.S Sorry for my English, i know i'm bad in it
